# Urlbar Top Sites Experiment Extension

This is the extension for the top sites experiment in Firefox's urlbar. When
installed, focusing the urlbar automatically opens the urlbar view and shows
your top sites, the same top sites shown on your new-tab page. (With one caveat:
The view does not automatically open when the current tab is the new-tab page
since it already shows your top sites.)

See [bug 1547279](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1547279).
